= Service Mesh Secure Egress Traffic Flow

[#06-sds]
== Secure Egress Traffic with mTLS

As you know, Gateway describes a load balancer operating at the edge of the mesh receiving incoming or outgoing HTTP/TCP connections.

During this step, you will review how to work with a secure HTTPS service through _Egress Gateway_ and a custom certificate. The main idea of this chapter is work with mesh external services using secure connections based on mTLS. You will create an external mTLS service and create a testing pod in your current namespace in order to test this mTLS connection via the _Egress Gateway_.

[#06-createservice]
== Create the _External Service_ 

In this part, you will create an _external service_ in Openshift but away from the _Service Mesh_ in order to create a secure service protected by mTLS.

Just a information, this service is based on Nginx server with a custom certificates generated with openssl.

[#06-addcert]
=== Add a Custom Certificate

First of all, it is required to create the certificates which will be used by the Nginx server in order to authorize client access.

Please, follow the next steps in order to create these certificates in Kubernetes secrets:

* Create secret to hold the server certificates

[.console-input]
[source,input,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
oc create -n <user_namespace>-mesh-external secret tls nginx-server-certs --key ./06-secure-egress-traffic-troubleshooting/3_application/private/nginx.example.com.key.pem --cert 06-secure-egress-traffic-troubleshooting/3_application/certs/nginx.example.com.cert.pem
----

.Server certificates OK
image::jump-app-mesh-external-svc-cert-ok.png[]

* Create secret to hold the CA certificates

[.console-input]
[source,input,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
oc create -n <user_namespace>-mesh-external secret generic nginx-ca-certs --from-file=06-secure-egress-traffic-troubleshooting/2_intermediate/certs/ca-chain.cert.pem
----

.CA certificates OK
image::jump-app-mesh-external-ca-cert-ok.png[]

[#06-createnginx]
=== Create Nginx service

Once the certificates have been created, you should create a configuration file which contains the security settings and then deploy the Nginx server.

Please, perform the following steps in order to meet the previous requirements:

* Create _nginx.conf_ file in a configmap

[.console-input]
[source,input,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
oc create configmap nginx-configmap -n <user_namespace>-mesh-external --from-file=nginx.conf=./06-secure-egress-traffic-troubleshooting/nginx.conf
----

.Nginx config file OK
image::jump-app-mesh-external-nginx-conf-ok.png[]

* Deploy the Nginx server

:file: 06-secure-egress-traffic-troubleshooting/00-nginx-svc-pod.yml
:namespace: <user_namespace>-mesh-external

include::partial$oc_process_apply.adoc[]

.Nginx deployment and service ok
image::jump-app-mesh-external-nginx-deployment-ok.png[]

* Check if the nginx pod is ready

[.console-input]
[source,input,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
oc get pods -n <user_namespace>-mesh-external
----

.Nginx pod ok
image::jump-app-mesh-external-nginx-pods-ok.png[]

* Check if the nginx service is ready

[.console-input]
[source,input,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
oc -n <user_namespace>-mesh-external rsh <nginx_pod_id>  curl localhost:443 -k
----

.Nginx service mTLS ERROR 
image::jump-app-mesh-external-nginx-svc-ok-404.png[]

NOTE: You have deployed a mTLS service and you are receiving a _400 Bad Request_ error because of not using certificates to access to this service


[#06-createtesting]
== Create the Testing Microservice

In order to test your Nginx service, it is required to create a microservice-based testing tool which allows you to stablish secure connections based on mTLS.

image::jump-app-test-tool.png[]

[#06-createtestingcerts]
=== Add a Custom Certificate 

First of all, it is required to create the client and CA certificates in order to be able to generate secure connections.

Please, follow the next steps to allocate these certificates in Kubernetes secret objects:

* Create Kubernetes Secrets to hold the client’s certificates

[.console-input]
[source,input,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
oc create -n <user_namespace> secret tls nginx-client-certs --key 06-secure-egress-traffic-troubleshooting/4_client/private/nginx.example.com.key.pem --cert 06-secure-egress-traffic-troubleshooting/4_client/certs/nginx.example.com.cert.pem
----

.Client certificates OK
image::jump-app-mesh-external-nginx-access-certs.png[]

* Create Kubernetes Secrets to hold the CA certificates

[.console-input]
[source,input,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
oc create -n <user_namespace> secret generic nginx-ca-certs --from-file=06-secure-egress-traffic-troubleshooting/2_intermediate/certs/ca-chain.cert.pem
----

.CA certificates OK
image::jump-app-mesh-external-nginx-access-ca-certs.png[]

[#06-createtestingdepl]
=== Create Testing Tool Deployment

Once the certificates have been saved in Openshift, it is time to deploy your testing microsevice deployment. Essentially, this microservice is a container image with _curl_ installed. 

Please, follow the next steps to deploy this new microservice in your main namespace:

* Create testing _Service_ and _Deployment_

:file: 06-secure-egress-traffic-troubleshooting/02-jump-app-sleep-svc-pod.yaml
:namespace: <user_namespace>

include::partial$oc_process_apply.adoc[]

.Testing service created
image::jump-app-mesh-external-nginx-client-pod.png[]

* Test service pod is runnign

[.console-input]
[source,input,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
oc get pods -n <user_namespace>
----

.Testing service pod OK
image::jump-app-mesh-external-nginx-client-pod-ok.png[]

[#06-createsevs]
=== Configure Nginx service Istio Objects

At this time, you have a Nginx secure service and a testing microservice installed and configured with a set of client/server certificates and their respective CA certificate.

Finally, it is required to create the _Istio_ object in order to make able the connectivity between your testing microservice and the _mesh-external_ Nginx service.

.Testing service -> Nginx service
image::jump-app-testing-nginx-connection.png[]

Please, follow the next steps to make able this connectivity through _Istio_ objects:

* Create a _ServiceEntry_ and a _VirtualService_ in your namespace

:file: 06-secure-egress-traffic-troubleshooting/01-jump-app-nginx-vs-se.yaml
:namespace: <user_namespace>

include::partial$oc_process_apply.adoc[]

.Nginx ServiceEntry and VirtualService ok
image::jump-app-mesh-external-nginx-access-objects.png[]

[#06-createsevstest]
=== Test Nginx service through testing tool

* Test nginx service via testing microservice

[.console-input]

NOTE: The IP value passed in the --resolve option (1.1.1.1 below) is not significant, any value other than 127.0.0.1 can be used

* Verify that the server requires the client’s certificate

* Clean the _ServiceEntry_ and _VirtualService_ in your namespace

[#06-configureegressaccess]
== Configure mutual TLS origination for egress traffic

image::jump-app-egress-traffic-graph.png[]

When you have the testing tool and the Nginx service up and running, it is time to introduce the _Egress Gateway_.

As you know, an _Egress Gateway_ defines exit points from the mesh. Egress gateways allow you to apply Istio features, for example, monitoring and route rules, to traffic exiting the mesh.

They are extensively used in organizations that have a strict security requirement that all traffic leaving the service mesh must flow through a set of dedicated nodes. These nodes will run on dedicated machines, separated from the rest of the nodes running applications in the cluster. These special nodes will serve for policy enforcement on the egress traffic and will be monitored more thoroughly than other nodes.

Another use case is a cluster where the application nodes don’t have public IPs, so the in-mesh services that run on them cannot access the Internet. Defining an egress gateway, directing all the egress traffic through it, and allocating public IPs to the egress gateway nodes allows the application nodes to access external services in a controlled way.

Taking this into account, it is time to create a set of _Istio objects_ in your namespace in order to make able this connectivity through the _Egress Gateway_. Please, follow the next steps to implement this scenario:

* Create a _Gateway_ for nginx.example.com, port 443, and _destination rules_ and _virtual services_ to direct the traffic through the egress gateway and from the egress gateway to the external service

:file: 06-secure-egress-traffic-troubleshooting/03-jump-app-egress-gw-dr.yaml
:namespace: <user_namespace>

=== Testing egress traffic

[#06-finalquestion]
== Final Question

IMPORTANT: *After this new scenario implementation where the traffic is redirected through the _Egress Gateway_... Are you sure the traffic is being redirected to your Nginx service?*
